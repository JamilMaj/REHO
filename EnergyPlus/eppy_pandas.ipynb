    "In the present case, what will be modified is the heating temperature setpoint. To do so, one must first understand how the `.idf` file works and how EnergyPlus manages them. The main structure EnergyPlus needs is a Schedule. A good ressource to understand this structure is [BigLadderSoftware](https://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/9-0/input-output-reference/group-schedules.html). In a nutshell, the structure of the Schedules are divided in 3 subparts:\n",
    "- Day Schedule (Schedule:Day:Hourly)\n",
    "- Week Schedule (Schedule:Week:Daily)\n",
    "- Year Schedule (Schedule:Year)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, other fields are available to help interface external data with idf files. In this example, the SIA norms are used to define the temperature setpoints. From the `.idf` files, it can be seen that the `Schedule:Day:List` fields is used to define the SIA norms. The index [2] and [3] are respectively defining the heating and cooling setpoints hour by hour. Let's access it with `eppy`."
